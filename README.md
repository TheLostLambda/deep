# Deep - A home-rolled library for deep-learning

This package is a toy-project intended to aid in the understanding of simple
neural networks and, consequentially, duplicates a lot of code and is rather
inefficient. There exist many better libraries for real deep-learning.

## Tasks

1. Write `learn` to auto-train perceptrons
2. Write tests for perceptrons
