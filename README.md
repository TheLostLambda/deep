# Deep - A home-rolled library for deep-learning

This package is a toy-project intended to aid in the understanding of simple
neural networks and, consequentially, duplicates a lot of code and is rather
inefficient. There exist many better libraries for real deep-learning.

## Tasks

1. Write tests for `*`, `mag`, and `norm`
2. Add matrices (type and operations)
